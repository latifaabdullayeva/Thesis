\section*{Acknowledgements}
I would like to thank my advisor, Donald Degraen, for his guidance and feedback.
Without his patience, support, and valuable advice, this venture would not have been possible.

Further, I want to thank Prof. Dr. Antonio Krüger for giving me an opportunity to write this
thesis under his supervision and for reviewing the thesis.
Also, I would like to thank Dr. Michael Schmitz for reviewing this thesis.

My deepest appreciation goes to my family and my boyfriend for their moral support, their continuous encouragement,
and their help whenever it was needed.

In addition, I would like to thank all people who participated in the user study and
provided their feedback.
