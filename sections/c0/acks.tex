Without his patience, support, and valuable advice, this venture would not have been possible.

Further, I want to thank Prof. Dr. Antonio Krüger for giving me an opportunity to write this
thesis under his supervision.
Also, I would like to thank Prof. Dr. Antonio Krüger and Dr. Michael Schmitz for reviewing my thesis.
