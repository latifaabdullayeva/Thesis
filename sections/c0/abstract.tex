\section*{Abstract}
In a Social Internet of Things environment, smart devices communicate with each other
by establishing their own social circles similar to human social networking.
While autonomous device interaction without human intervention increases scalability
and enhances network navigability, users might misinterpret actions occurring between devices.
We are motivated in finding an approach to help users to understand unintelligible behaviors in such systems.
In our prototype, we consider the cooperation between 4 different devices,
i.e a Mascot, a Bench, a Tablet, and Speakers.
The state of the devices in our system depends on the user’s movements by tracking their Mascots.
Each Mascot can be assigned with a unique personality according to the Big Five Personality Trait model.
In a user study, we would like to understand how assigned personalities
are able to clarify autonomous interactions between devices.
For this, we will explore how participants associate the personality of
each Mascot with the predefined actions of all devices as a whole for several case studies.
